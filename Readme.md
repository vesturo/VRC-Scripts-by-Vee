Hi, repo for things i figure out :)

## Scripts in this Repository:
### [VRChat Group join Button](https://github.com/vesturo/VRC-Scripts-by-Vee/tree/main/scripts/CreatorEconomy)
- Just a simple script to open a Group page inside of VRChat if you press the button!
### [Advanced Stringloader](https://github.com/vesturo/VRC-Scripts-by-Vee/tree/main/scripts/Stringloading)
- Stringloader on Steroids, supporting Untrusted URLs on top of trusted URLs
### [PostProcessing Switcher for ProTV 3.0.0+ & VideoTXL](https://github.com/vesturo/VRC-Scripts-by-Vee/tree/main/scripts/PostProcessing%20Switch)
- Switches between two PP profiles depending on if a video is playing or not! (this has prefabs included)


Idk, [throw money at me if you like](https://ko-fi.com/vesturo) or make pull requests to add more cool stuff to this repo, both work for me c:
