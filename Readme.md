Hi, repo for things i figure out :)

## How 2 Group button:
- ### MAKE A BACKUP
- ### MAKE SURE YOUR BACKUP IS OKAY
- Update your SDK to 3.5.1 or later
- copy the "OpenGroupPage" script
- assign script to button
- find you group ID (ex grp_0c89d633-b4e6-4359-8496-cb14ca80889b for myriad)
- put group ID in group id field :D

## How 2 use Stringloader
- The stringloader is made in a way that you can add both an untrusted URL and a Github link :) reason for that is that an Untrusted URL gives more freedom to update files faster, while Github Pages usually need a minute or two to re-deploy

## No clue how to use U#? download my Repo, copy the folder "GroupButton into your assets follow above!
